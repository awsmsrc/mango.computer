## About the group

ManGo is an inclusive group of people of all abilities, from Go newbies to advanced users. We aim to be friendly, welcoming and have fun learning about, and sharing, our interest in the Go programming language.

We are based in Manchester, UK and meet at TechHub every month on the second Wednesday:

We aim to have talks every month, but if there are no talks there will be a social meet.

ManGo was started in July 2014 by [Will Jessop](http://willj.net), [email him](mailto:willj.net) if you have any questions or suggestions.
